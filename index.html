        <h2>Hello people!</h2> 
          <p>I am 23 years old computer science student living in Jyväskylä, Finland.
          Born and raised in Helsinki and a proud alumnus of Oulunkylän yhteiskoulu.<br>
          Currently working on my bachelor's thesis about computational thinking and its challenges.
          As a university student my intrests are pretty much in programming and educational technology. My minor is in educational
          sciences and I am studying to have a competence to teach information technology. I speak Finnish as my native language and my
          English is fluent together with good skills in Swedish.<br>
          I feel confident around computers and 
          programming is one of my hobbies in my spare time. I am also very much into listening music, playing sports and having beer
          with friends. In fact I own around 200 vinyl records. Also being in the kitchen is very close to my heart.
          <br>
          Right now I'm looking for a place to work for summer. Everything in the field of information technology intrests me. More
          about my skills and done work is found in sections "porfolio" and "skills".

        <h2>Educational <span>(part of me)</span></h2>
          <p>As I mentioned in About-section, I'm very interested in educational part of information technology. 
            One is able to read my thoughts about teaching and being a teacher from <a href="https://peda.net/p/laitjoo/prope-sivusto"><b>here</b></a>.
            </br>
            My first time as a student teacher is happening this March (2022).
            All of my courses within teacher studies have been completed with very good grades so far.
          </p>
        <h2>Programmer <span>(part of me)</span></h2>
          <p>
            Alongside teaching stuff I'm also very much into programming things I might think as useful. Most of my work is available and can be seen
            in my <a href="https://github.com/jjalaitinen"><b>GitHub</b></a>. There are plenty of work I've done in school and my personal projects.
            <br>
            My largest single project was in last autumn. Me and three other computer science students from Jyväskylä University 
            developed a large software for modeling usage of citybikes (Alepafillari) in Helsinki. For more information about this project one can contact me.
            <br>
            Me and few of my friends are at the moment programming a Discord bot and project as well as my contribution to it can be seen <a href="https://github.com/tupepi/lanttupoika"><b>here</b></a>.
            <br> <br>
            In University I've completed programming-oriented courses with laudable grades.
            <br><br>
            Programming 1 (C#) - 4
            <br>
            Programming 2 (Java) - 4

          </p>
          <h2>Work history</h2>
          <p> I've worked in many different places and I have experience in many different fields. I'm still lacking in my own field of work and looking for that kind of a job.</p>

            Considering this as a one of the first languages I learned. Basics from Helsinki and advanced skills via Programming 2 course 
            in Jyväskylä. I have also used Java as a main programming language in Algorithms courses.

          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p>
            With Python I completed software security basics course in Jyväskylä and I have used it for a programming language on my spare time.
            It's also one of the languages we used in our group project last autumn. Flask development became also familiar during that.

          <h3>JavaScript</h3>
          <p>
            One of the hardest course for me was with JavaScript, Web UI-design. But I managed well and since then JavaScript has been easier.
            JavaScript had also a huge impact in our group project since about 60% of its source code is .js. We worked with leaflet, AJAX and
            jQuery.

            Just to mention I have also worked with C#. My first Programming course here in Jyväskylä was with C# and I've learned the consepts of
            programming with it. Also my first bigger project, a videogame using Jypeli-library is wirtten in C#.

            projects I've encountered need of these skills. I count in also animation, responsiveness, different elements and UI.

            I'm most confident with Windows environment (CMD) but working with Linux is familiar too (Terminal). Git is familiar from many different occasions and
            I've used SVN also as a revision control. Scrum-ish development is well-known from the project course and I've studied a whole course about
            developing information systems. Office tools and basic IT-skills are - of course - up to date.

            My minor. I am completely smitten with educational side of IT. Actually wanting to make world a better place by teaching people more about
            computers and possibilities one can have with them. I still have much to learn yet even greater intrest in it.

            fast to learn new things and adapt to new environments and protocols. I aim to be ready to tackle obsticles to achieve the better solution.

            Also keep in mind that these graphs are just my thoughts about my skill level. Skills should not anyways be modelled by percentages.
            I just wondered that it would be a nice way to fill up my site. After all humans tend to enjoy watching graphs to please their minds. Of
            course it's hard to evaluate yourself but yet important skill that I want to get better at.
